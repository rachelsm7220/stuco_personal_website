    <div class='about-txt'> <br> LEARNING AND EXPLORING ARE MY PASSION.
<br> <br> Hi, I am Rachel Kim, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying product design with a concentration in physical computing. <br> <br>  I study design because I truly believe that design is a powerful tool to solve problems and create meaningful experiences for people. Through designing physical and digital interactions, I hope to deliver well-crafted experiences to people. My motivation to design originates from the transformative power of design that can change the lives of people. I enjoy learning new skills and exploring new views, new people, and new environments from many different interactions.  <br> <br> You can always find me playing with textiles, sketching ideas, doodling, and making products in shop.  <br> </div>
